# MRI Brain Tumor Classification Using Kernel-based SVM and Wavelet Transformation

## Introduction

This repository contains the code, dataset, and resources for the "MRI Brain Tumor Classification Using Kernel-based SVM and Wavelet Transformation" project. Our goal is to accurately classify MRI brain scans based on their tumor characteristics.

## Dataset

The dataset comprises MRI brain scans from three classes:
- Benign Tumors
- Malignant Tumors
- Normal Scans

Please note that due to data privacy, the actual dataset is not included in this repository. However, you can use your own dataset or acquire a similar one to replicate the project.

## Methodology

1. **Preprocessing:** The MRI images undergo preprocessing to enhance features and eliminate noise.
2. **Wavelet Transformation:** Wavelet transformation is applied to extract relevant features in the frequency domain.
3. **Feature Extraction:** The transformed coefficients are used as features for classification.
4. **Kernel-based SVM:** A kernel-based SVM is trained on the extracted features for classification.
5. **Model Evaluation:** The trained model is evaluated using various metrics.

## Project Structure

The repository structure is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Directory for storing the dataset (not included in this repository).
- `PROJECT_MRI_Brain_Tumor_Classification.ipynb"
- `README.md`: This README file.
